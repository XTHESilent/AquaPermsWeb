Hello! :wave:

Welcome to the AquaPerms wiki. Here you will find a complete set of documentation for the plugin, outlining how to install, setup, configure and effectively use AquaPerms.

### Where to start?
If you've never used a permissions plugin before, we suggest you just start at the top and work your way down!

The basics of permissions are covered in detail in the [Getting Started](Usage) page.

A more to the point command reference can be found in the [Command Usage](Command-Usage) subpages.

### How to get heap

Support for the project is provided on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FSKERv5qsD).

We would appreciate it if you try to look for an answer to your question here on the wiki first. It saves us having to repeatedly answer the same questions!

In particular, check the [FAQ](FAQ) page and the "How To" section. ðŸ™‚
